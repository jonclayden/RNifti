Description: Provides very fast read and write access to images stored in the
    NIfTI-1 and ANALYZE-7.5 formats, with seamless synchronisation between
    compiled C and interpreted R code. Also provides a simple image viewer, and
    a C/C++ API that can be used by other packages. Not to be confused with
    'RNiftyReg', which performs image registration.
