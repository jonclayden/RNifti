Description: Provides very fast read and write access to images stored in the
    NIfTI-1 and ANALYZE-7.5 formats, with seamless synchronisation between
    compiled C and interpreted R code. Also provides a C/C++ API that can be
    used by other packages. Not to be confused with 'RNiftyReg', which performs
    image registration.
