Description: Provides very fast access to images stored in the NIfTI-1 file
    format <http://www.nitrc.org/docman/view.php/26/64/nifti1.h>, with seamless
    synchronisation between compiled C and interpreted R code. Not to be
    confused with 'RNiftyReg', which provides tools for image registration.
