Description: Provides very fast read and write access to images stored in the
    NIfTI-1, NIfTI-2 and ANALYZE-7.5 formats, with seamless synchronisation
    of in-memory image objects between compiled C and interpreted R code. Also
    provides a simple image viewer, and a C/C++ API that can be used by other
    packages. Not to be confused with 'RNiftyReg', which performs image
    registration and applies spatial transformations.
